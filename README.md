# SAT_Research
Repo for all the files during SS2021 research project on Ramsey Theory and SAT solvers.

# Note

The script will use the following modules:

- Maple
- SCIP - for finding integer solutions much faster.
- Perl
- Python 3

The C++ Rado generator served as an improvement from Maple.

- Use SCIP to find all solutions to Ax=b
- Linear read/write to files(areas of improvement)

The following SAT solvers I want to give credit to:

- satch: https://github.com/arminbiere/satch
- glucose(parallel) : https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/
- minisat: http://minisat.se/

Script that I modified:

- Shatter's perl script
- Use in conjunction with symmetry breaking clause parser python script
